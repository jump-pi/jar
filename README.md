# jump-pi jar

This repository delivers a single jump-pi.jar file that includes a very lean persistence framework and a simple Java REST API development framework.  
It can be used in a JEE application (see jump-pi/war project) or in a stand alone Java program.  
Jump-pi could implement other frameworks like Derby, Spring (REST), Hibernate or DataNucleous (JPA) keeping the same high level interface, so the migration path is guaranteed.  
This version has minimun dependencies with other frameworks and it is intended to be used from Embedded Systems to high scale parallelized systems.
