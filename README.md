# jump-pi jar

This repository delivers a single jump-pi.jar file that includes a very lean persistence framework and a simple Java REST API development framework. 
It can be used in a JEE application (see jump-pi/war project) or in a stand alone Java program.
Other frameworks like Derby or Hibernate (JPA) could be used keeping the same high level jump-pi framework interface, but this version is intended to be used from Embedded Systems to high scale parallelized systems.
